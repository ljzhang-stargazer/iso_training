Homework 2: Yelp

Time spent: 30 hours spent in total

Completed user stories (with check-mark):

Search results page

 * [x] Custom cells should have the proper Auto Layout constraints
 * [x] Search bar should be in the navigation bar (doesn't have to expand to show location like the real Yelp app does).
 * [ ] Optional: Table rows should be dynamic height according to the content height
 * [ ] Optional: infinite scroll for restaurant results
 * [ ] Optional: Implement map view of restaurant results

Filter page. Unfortunately, not all the filters are supported in the Yelp API.

 * [x] The filters you should actually have are: category, sort (best match, distance, highest rated), radius (meters), deals (on/off).
 * [x] The filters table should be organized into sections as in the mock.
 * [ ] You can use the default UISwitch for on/off states. Optional: implement a custom switch
 * [ ] Categories should show a subset of the full list with a "See All" row to expand. 
 * [ ] Clicking on the "Search" button should dismiss the filters page and trigger the search w/ the new filter settings.
